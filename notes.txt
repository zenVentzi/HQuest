1) Questions

Which part is the question part? Is there any? Or shall we put all the data into the Answer component? What is the answer?
Is the answer plain yes or no? For now yes. Later, we can add more such as once a week etc. I.e. there is no need for
separating with *2nd*. The whole would you is going to be the question and the answers are going to be yes & no.
WEll, this becomes a plain options question.. why not simply use option type? E.g. WOuld you be rich but you have to eat shit?
Select an option.. yes/no/once a week etc.
