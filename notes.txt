Problem: answered returns undefined.
Solutions:
1) Check if it is undefined, then only updat the unanswered
2) If undefined, make it an empty array, then write that empty array with write query.
3) Create 2 different functions. updateAnswered and updateUnanswered. There is going to be repetition there. But the alternative is to do if null checks in the currently existing method
