Solution/s:..

- store the profile pic file path in database
- save the profile pic to public/users/user_1/profilepic.png

1) Search users
2) Log out
3) Avatar

Should usersContent folder be made public? WHere to store it?
If the directory were /protected/user/ and the information could only be accessed through a PHP that would resolve my only concern. 

Webpack doens't have to load the users files. They should simply be accessible. How? Hash vs folder ids?
If I use express static b4 webpack, if the file is found it will be sent and the process will be interrupted

1) Save the avatar as {hash}.png in assets/ folder.
2) Save the hash name at avatarSrc
